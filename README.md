# Readwise Daily (WIP)

## Motivation

I use [readwise's daily](https://readwise.io) tool to remind myself of Kindle highlights I have made in the past. The goal of this project is to enable this as a CLI tool.

## How This Works

This is a work in progress. In order to activate this, we run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

In order for this to work, you will need a readwise account, along with an API key.

## The Goal

To run this on CLI with a command like:
```bash
readwise-daily
```
